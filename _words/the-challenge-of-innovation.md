We’ve learned that large-scale innovation isn’t just about innovating products and services. 95% of the challenge is innovating with people. People who, although they might agree with the need for innovation in theory, have potentially conflicting ideas of what innovation looks like in practice. Civic team members need to be able to navigate this vibrant landscape effectively in order to meaningfully engage city staff and deliver useful, durable, user-driven outcomes for both staff and residents.

Did you know that something as seemingly straightforward as getting a permit for a residential shed can actually involve city staff from up to 10 departmental or working groups? Delivering city services requires the coordination and collaboration of staff from various groups, each with their own focus or area of expertise. In the City of Austin for example, staff in Plan Review, Watershed Protection, and Tree Preservation may need to collaborate in order to issue a resident’s shed permit. As city staff interact, they encounter diverse perspectives, needs, workplace norms, and communication styles, not to mention different interpretations of rules and ordinances. Delivering city services means making sure each group is aligned within the city system.

Although the process of inter-group collaboration within city service delivery may seem convoluted, it doesn’t have to be. Being able to successfully engage city staff comes down to building relationships that can support tough conversations on complex issues. We can’t underscore the importance of the human dimension enough! Bringing together diverse city staff to tackle complex issues in a constructive way, will help innovative cities achieve useful, enduring, user-driven outcomes.
