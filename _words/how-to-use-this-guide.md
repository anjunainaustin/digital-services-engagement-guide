This guide has been organized into three parts:

* **Part 1** offers guidance for engaging the city department or working group directly involved with the process you, or anyone on the project team, are seeking to improve. That process is part of a larger city system.

* So *Part 2** expands your view of engagement and provides guidance on engaging the system of key players impacting the process.

* Once youâ€™ve met all key players, meaningful engagement means building and maintaining connections with them, and **Part 3** offers strategies and guidance for doing just that.
